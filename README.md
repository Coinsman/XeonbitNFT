# ðŸ—ƒ NFT Minter Tutorial Starter Files

This project contains the starter files for [Alchemy's NFT Minter tutorial](https://docs.alchemyapi.io/alchemy/tutorials/nft-minter), in which we teach you how to connect your smart contract to your React dApp project by building an NFT Minter using Metamask and Web3.

How to:
- Install Metamask and set up your crypto wallet extension on your browser. We are using Kovan Testnet.
- Update .env file (Sign up PINATA and ALCHEMY to get KEY)
- Clone this git
- npm install
- npm start
